## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-   According to the Pivotchart and table of Theater Outcomes by LaunchDate
-   The Successful outcomes are more in the month of May and June.
-   After the June month the Successful outcomes has steadily dropped and by the end of the year in December month 
    there were only 2 successful outcomes compared to failed.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
-   According to the Outcomes based on Goals Pivot chart and table
-    The percentage of goals successful and failed complemented each other as the goal value increased for the subcategory Plays.
-    At the lower goal value the successful percentage is more and vice versa.
-    The number of total successful projects are double compared to failed with lesser goal value.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
-   Dataset is huge and hard to analyse without breaking down to parent and subcategory columns.
-   Finding the relation between different columns was difficult without the details.
-   Theres no summary of whats expected.   

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  -We could generate how many staff picked goals outcomes within the deadline are successful, failed or canceled applying a country filter.
